## What is a REST API and why do I care?
REST - Representational State Transfer
- A software architecture that defines how web service should be designed
- Takes advantage of HTTP verbs to dictate which actins are requested by the client and uses the URL and query string to identify which resources are being acted upon.

A REST API allows different systems to exchange data using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. REST APIs return data in various formats, with JSON and XML being the most common.
