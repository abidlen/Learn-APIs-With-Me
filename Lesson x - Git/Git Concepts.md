Git Concepts

## What is a Version Control System?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## What is Git?
Git is the most popular Version Control System (VCS). More specifically, it is a Distributed VCS
- It does not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files.
- Instead, every user “clones” a copy of a repository (a collection of files) and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This clone has all of the metadata of the original while the original itself is stored on a self-hosted server or a third party hosting service like GitHub.
